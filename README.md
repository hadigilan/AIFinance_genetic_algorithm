# AIFinance_genetic_algorithm

This repository provides the required files for tutorial 2 (Genetic Algorithm with R) for the course Artificial Intelligence in Finance (ACCFIN5230), 
at the Adam Smith Business School, University of Glasgow, 2022-23.

# R code
We use the ga function from [GA package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GA/) to implement genetic algorithm in R. We have four examples to show the applications of this package.

## Examples
1) One-dimensional minimization
2) One-dimensional maximization
3) Global (absolute) maximum 
4) Two-dimensional optimization (OLS regression with genetic algorithm)

# The PwerPoint file
There is a good bibliography along with a short review on the advantages of genetic algorithm.
